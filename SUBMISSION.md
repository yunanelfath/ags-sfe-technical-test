### Add your submission notes here

1. paginate the data instead of rendering 200 record that will break the UI
2. added @mui/material for Syling and UI Library since the are lots of built in component library and can rewrite the styling easily
3. added spinner loading to show the user that the app are still load in the page
4. unnecessary render with useMemo to reduce the rendering complexity when we search by the keyword, categories and sort
